Hi,
Please post your comments/discussion points on weekly readings here for all to see. Please post them by 9pm the day before class.

As we talked about at the end of last class, it would be useful if each of the replication/extension teams also had another team to look over and comment on their code. Here is what that schedule looks like:
Jan 19: Growth; Replication by Harunobu and Jan; coding comments by Handi, Qing 
Feb 2: Experiments; Replication by Zeren, Mitch; coding comments by Phan, Edison, Yicheng
Feb 9: Geography; Replication by Dean, Diego; coding comments by Zeren, Mitch
Feb 16: Colonialism: Replication by Harunobu and Jan ; coding comments by Handi, Qing
Feb 23: Order: Replication by Handi, Qing; coding comments by Harunobu, Jan
Mar 2: Macro institutions by Dean, Diego; coding comments by Phan, Edison, Yicheng
Mar 9: Micro—property/land by Zeren, Mitch; coding comments by Dean, Diego
